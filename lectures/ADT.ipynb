It’s usually not OK to have a chain of if/elif/elif with insinstance checks performing different actions depending on the type of an object: you should be using polymorphism for that—i.e., designing your classes so that the interpreter dispatches calls to the proper methods\n",

    ">On the other hand, it’s usually OK to perform an insinstance check against an ABC if you must enforce an API contract: “Dude, you have to implement this if you want to call me,” as technical reviewer Lennart Regebro put it. That’s particularly useful in sys‐ tems that have a plug-in architecture. Outside of frameworks, duck typing is often sim‐ pler and more flexible than type checks.\n",

    "## Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind refactoring is to make sure we have no repeated code, everything is readable and testable, and most importantly, you have made it easier for future you. The usual direction this modularity goes in is to have many small classes and functions with loose coupling between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the pros and cons to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- small classes/modules mean interfaces with only few abstract procedures.\n",
    "- thid means simple specs for interfaces\n",
    "- this also means invariants are local. What is this? For the many functions part of modularity we can judge and test what a function does independent of the other functions. Now, with AbsFun and RepInv, we can do the same for ADT.\n",
    "- Notice that this makes writing pre-and post-conditions harder. If you remember out binary search implementation we could have modularized it further, but communicating the pre-and-post conditions would have got harder with greater modularity. Still, remember how complex our binary-search spec was?.\n",
    "- the correctness is now easier to reason about and test on a per function and per-method basis\n",
    "- but we are less performant because we have many additional function calls. Also since everything is not at one place, its harder to play optimization tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**You must exercise your own judgement** as to where you want to make this tradeoff between loose coupling/modularity and tight coupling/performance. As scientists, we are often exposed to the latter: a performant array for example precludes all sorts of nice streaming algorithms, duplicates memory, etc and makes things more monolithic. But where it is an advantage to ease of programming, it behooves us to choose narrow and nice interfaces. We'll see an example of this next time.\n"
