    "### Concurrency, Parallelism, and the GIL\n",
    "\n",
    "Last time we saw that Python has a GIL, which allows only one thread to run python code at a time. It was made to allow non-thread safe code to run, fast, in a single thread, which is a very common case.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run python code, we have no control over the GIL. But extension modules written in C can release the GIL while doing time-consuming tasks. We'll see how to do this 2 weeks from now. numpy does this, so for example, dot-products happen in a C context outside the GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the standard library functions that do blocking IO also release the GIL, so that python code can continue to run while waiting for network-IO. This means that if you use threads or some other concurrency mechanism, while one unit of concurrency is waiting for a response from the netweork or a read from disk, another unit can continue doing something CPU-bound. (IO-code typically does this by using select with a 0 secs timeout, and we shall adress this in the next lecture)\n",
    "\n",
    ">David Beazley says: “Python threads are great at doing nothing.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The time.sleep() function also releases the GIL. The whole thing looks a bit like this:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see threads and processes the next time around. But threads take 50k of memory per thread and are expensive to switch to, and the OS has a hard limit on threads. Instead, we we could create granular units of processing and IO-checking an IO-doing within the process, we could have our one thread running at full capacity rather than waiting on IO, at a low overhead.\n",

Still, it is useful in CPU bound situations as well: as we shall see, it is extremely useful to scheduling multiple cpu bound things in byte sized chunks.

Using .send(...), the caller of the generator can post data that then becomes the value of the yield expression inside the generator function. This allows a generator to be used as a coroutine: a procedure that collaborates with the caller, yielding and receiving values from the caller.\n",

    ">The latest evolutionary step for coroutines came with PEP 380 - Syntax for Delegating to a Subgenerator, implemented in Python 3.3 (2012). PEP 380 made two syntax changes to generator functions, to make them more useful as coroutines:\n",
    "- A generator can now return a value; previously, providing a value to the return statement inside a generator raised a SyntaxError.\n",
    "- The `yield from` syntax enables complex generators to be refactored into smaller, nested generators while avoiding a lot of boilerplate code previously required for a generator to delegate to subgenerators.\n"

    "- -f `next` is called, or `None` is senr in, the subgens `__next__()` is called, which can result in a `StopIteration`, which resumes the delegating gen at the `yield from` statement.\n",
