    "\n",
    "From Younker's Agile Python Development:\n",
    "\n",
    ">TDD uses very small development cycles. Tests aren’t written for entire functions. They are written incrementally as the functions are composed. If the chunks get too large, a test- driven developer can always back down to a smaller chunk.\n",
    "The cycles have a distinct four-part rhythm. A test is written, and then it is executed to verify that it fails. A test that succeeds at this point tells you nothing about your new code. (Every day I encounter one that works when I don’t expect it to.) After the test fails, the associ- ated code is written, and then the test is run again. This time it should pass. If it passes, then the process begins anew.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of this is that focusses you on the interface of your function/class, etc. The downside is that it precludes exploration and exploration tests, where you might try different interfaces. Another danger is write you might write tons of small units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should you do it? TDD is certainly useful at times, but make sure you do it when you have a concrete idea where you are going..."
